%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% NOTES %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%This script assumes you are already in the local directory of the image
%files and that files were collected on the Tietjen Lab EVOS scope and have
%the standard file names *.dX.TIF where dX is one of d0, d1, d2, or d3 for
%the various color channels.

% Get files names for each of the 4 channels
